# WordPress Content Styling Implementation

## Summary
I've significantly improved your WordPress headless CMS setup to properly display content with the exact same formatting as it appears in WordPress, including tables, links, and all other elements.

## What I've Implemented

### 1. Enhanced WordPress API Integration
- Updated `wordpress-api.ts` to properly handle WordPress REST API responses
- Maintained compatibility with embedded content (authors, featured media, categories, tags)
- Proper error handling and data validation

### 2. WordPress Content Component (`enhanced-wordpress-content.tsx`)
This is the main component that ensures WordPress content displays exactly as intended:

#### Features:
- **Tables**: Fully styled with borders, headers, striped rows, hover effects
- **Links**: Highlighted with primary color, external link indicators
- **Images**: Rounded corners, shadow effects, click-to-zoom functionality
- **Code Blocks**: Proper syntax highlighting and formatting
- **Blockquotes**: Styled with left border and background
- **Lists**: Proper spacing and styling
- **Headings**: Hierarchical styling with borders for H1/H2
- **Paragraphs**: Proper text color and spacing

#### WordPress Block Support:
- Gallery blocks with grid layout
- Button blocks with proper styling
- Column layouts
- Media and text blocks
- Pullquotes with large quote marks
- Separator blocks

### 3. WordPress Post Page (`wordpress-post-page.tsx`)
A dedicated component for displaying WordPress posts that:
- Uses the enhanced content component
- Displays post metadata (author, date, reading time, word count)
- Shows categories and tags
- Includes sharing functionality
- Has a reading progress bar
- Responsive design

### 4. Updated Global CSS
Added comprehensive WordPress-specific styles to `globals.css`:
- Table styling that matches WordPress defaults
- Image hover effects and responsive behavior
- Link highlighting and transitions
- Code block styling
- Quote block styling
- List styling
- WordPress classic editor compatibility

### 5. Updated Blog Post Page
Modified `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` to:
- Use the new WordPress API structure
- Properly handle WordPress post data
- Use the enhanced WordPress post component
